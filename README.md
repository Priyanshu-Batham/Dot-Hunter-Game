## 🚀 How to Run

> Make sure all required dependencies are installed for **both frontend and backend**.

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Open the App
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Open it in **two separate browser tabs** to test multiplayer

## 🎮 Multiplayer Notes

- Multiplayer currently supports **two players only**
- While entering player names:
  - **Only Player 1’s name is used from your end**
- Other selections (AI, color, etc.) are **ignored in multiplayer mode**
- The game board is rendered on the server at a fixed size:
  - **800 × 600 pixels** (temporary limitation)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Ensure **both servers are running simultaneously**
- Multiplayer behavior may change as features are expanded
